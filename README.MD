# GifTastic

### Overview

In this application, I will use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of choice. The call to the GIPHY API is with JavaScript; jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

# Instructions

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

#Note:

- This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

### Achieved goals

- The app is fully mobile responsive.

- It will allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.

- Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page. Also the request will not overwrite the existing gifs.

- Metadata such as: (title, tags, etc) for each gif is in a clean and readable format.

- A 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types.

- Allow's users to add their favorite gifs to a `favorites` section.
  - This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
